    What is your dataset? 
    Why did you choose this particular dataset?
    What was your goal for the end user’s experience? <br><br>

    <p>The visualization is based on data from <a href="https://portal.opendata.dk/dataset/samlede-socio-data-kbh/resource/37bc1c1a-1f57-4fcb-8b20-2a3b5b67c537">portal.opendata.dk</a> 
    and was released by the municipality of Copenhagen. The original data set contains 2764 rows corresponding to observations distributed on 394 areas of Copenhagen. 
    For each area, we have seven data observations, one for each year ranging from 2008 to 2014. For 2014 a lot of information is missing and therefore it has been 
    chosen to exclude this year since it would not be very informative. 
    There are in total 102 attributes, including various socio-economic data, but only the ones explaining the age, income and educational distribution together with the 
    binding attributes area number and year is used in the visualization. <br>
    The dataset were chosen since we thought it would be interesting to see the difference in age distribution and educational level compared with the income level in 
    the different areas of Copenhagen. </p>

    <h2>Basic stats</h2>
    <script type="text/javascript"></script>
    Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing
    Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.<br><br>

    <p>We chose to preproses the data such that the data needed were available. This is for example the sum of the different agegroups and the different educational 
    levels for the years which were not available in the original dataset. </p>

    <h2>Visualizations</h2>

    Explain the visualizations you’ve chosen.
    Why are they right for the story you want to tell? <br><br>

    <p>The map is essential to the visualization since this should show if any areas of Copenhagen is more likely to be inhabited by high, middle or low income people.
    The histogram and the stacked area chart is made to see if the reason for these patterns lies in the distribution of age in the area and the educational level. 
    The histogram is a simple way to see how big a difference there is in the different agegroups. The stacked area chart shows both the development of the different 
    educational levels over the years and the size difference betweemn these. </p>
