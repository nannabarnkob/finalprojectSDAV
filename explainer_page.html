    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    What is your dataset? 
    Why did you choose this particular dataset?
    What was your goal for the end user’s experience? <br><br>

    <p>The visualization is based on data from <a href="https://portal.opendata.dk/dataset/samlede-socio-data-kbh/resource/37bc1c1a-1f57-4fcb-8b20-2a3b5b67c537">portal.opendata.dk</a> 
      and was released by the municipality of Copenhagen. The original data set contains 2764 rows corresponding to observations distributed on 394 areas of Copenhagen. 
      For each area, we have seven data observations, one for each year ranging from 2008 to 2014. For 2014 a lot of information is missing and therefore it has been 
      chosen to exclude this year since it would not be very informative. 
      There are in total 102 attributes, including various socio-economic data, but only the ones explaining the age, income and educational distribution together with the 
      binding attributes area number and year is used in the visualization. <br>
      All members of the group have some kind of relationship to Copenhagen and therefore it were interesting to learn more about our city.
      The dataset were chosen since we thought it would be interesting to see the difference in age distribution and educational level compared with the income level in 
      the different areas of Copenhagen. We wanted to see if there were any patterns in which areas is the most attractive to live in for people with a high income 
      and vice verca. Also we wanted to see if areas with for example a dorm located could be spotted in these attributes. 
    </p>

    <h2>Basic stats</h2>
    Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing
    Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis.<br><br>

    <p>We chose to preproses the data such that the data needed were available. This is for example the sum of the different agegroups and the different educational 
      levels for the years which were not available in the original dataset. 
      Doing the project it became clear to us that some datapoint where missing. That was for example for some areas where we found that the data about age and/or 
      educational level were not available. <br>
      Some of the exploratory analysis we made were looking at the age distribution in an area like Rigshospitalet where a dorm is located. Therefore we looked at the 
      agedistribution, educational level and income level for this area which can be seen in following:
    </p>
    
    <img src = "ageDistribution.png", width = "400", height = "245"> <img src = "educational.png", width = "400", height = "250"> 
    <img src = "incomeLevel.png", width = "250", height = "255">

    <p>What can be seen in the age distribution is that there is more than double as many in the highest agegroup 18-29 than the nearest agegroup 30-39. When looking at 
      the educational level it is clear to see that most of the people in this area are during education. This leads to the income level where only a few is
      having a high income and the most is having a low income which is normal during education. <br>
      This is an example of a pattern the visualization should show.

    <h2>Genre</h2>
    Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Visual Narrative (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?
    Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why? <br><br>

    <h4>Visual structuring</h4>
      <p>We have chosen to use a consistent visual platform where the overall design is always intact and only the content in different elements is changed.
        By doing this it is easy to compare the age distribution and educational level from the previous depending on year and/or area. <br> 
        We have made a kind of time bar to show the progress of the income level during the available years (2008-2013). </p>
    <h4>Highlighting</h4> 
      <p>In the map we have chosen that the user can make a close up to a wanted area to look closer to this area. <br>
        Again to show the change in each plot we have used motion when updating the histogram and stacked area chart to really show for example the changes in the order.
      </p>
    <h4>Transition guidance</h4> 
      <p>As said before we have made motion in our plots to show difference. This is done by animated transition in the histogram and stacked area chart. </p>
    <h4>Ordering</h4> 
      <p>Overall the ordering is random but intuitively the user should click the different years to see the development over the years and/or selecting the areas
        to see this development for an area and therefore there is a touch of user directed ordering. 
      </p>
    <h4>Interactivity</h4>
      <p>If the user wants to see the values in each plot and additional information hover highlighting with details is made available. This helps telling the story 
        about the attributes and helps the user understand the plots. <br>
        One navigation button has been created such that the user can go from viewing one area to see the full map with all areas. <br>
        We have used stimulating default views with starting data for 2008 to get the viewer interested in exploring the other years and the other effects. 
      </p>
    <h4>Messaging</h4> 
      <p>First of all we have used captions/headlines to make an overview of what is happening on the page and which elements can be seen. <br>
        Annotations have been used in the tooltips to give additional information and explanation of the visualization. <br>
        Since both a histogram with the age distrubtion and a stacked area chart with the educational level is shown multi-messaging is also used. These can individually 
        show something about an area but also together. <br>
        A short introduction text have been made so the user is in no doubt what this is about and is also helping with making the user interested. </p>


    <h2>Visualizations</h2>
    Explain the visualizations you’ve chosen.
    Why are they right for the story you want to tell? <br><br>

    <p>The map is essential to the visualization since this should show if any areas of Copenhagen is more likely to be inhabited by high, middle or low income people.
      The histogram and the stacked area chart is made to see if the reason for these patterns lies in the distribution of age in the area and the educational level
      to see these patterns as was seen with the dorm in Rigshospitalet. 
      The histogram is a simple way to see how big a difference there is in the different agegroups. The stacked area chart shows both the development of the different 
      educational levels over the years and the size difference betweemn these.
